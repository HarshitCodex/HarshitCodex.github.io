\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Working with the Business Insights Platform team to provide fast and accurate metrics of workspace applications to customers through Admin Console.
\item Created a new infrastructure for scheduling and computing 20+ metrics for more than 400K customers and serving them on the UI with minimal latency over a 12PB+ storage system on BigQuery.
\item Improved the serving time by 75\% and reduced duplicate logs by >99.5\% along with delivering resource savings of >1.5 SWE years with the new infrastructure design.
\item Improve Sign-In logs discoverability and robustness by implementing infrastructure for additional 30+ sign-in types to be recorded and served to customer across multiple endpoints.
\item Designed and implemented multiple ultra-parallel flumes to perform data integrity validations and data comparisons across multiple databases with extremely fast computation and minimal time complexity.
